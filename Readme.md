# Covert Transaction Graph Detection and Protection

### Here is the implementation of the paper *"Graph-based Covert Transaction Detection and Protection in Blockchain"*.

One of them, ***Detection***, is how to use graph structure metrics to distinguish between normal and covert transactions, and contains the normal and covert transaction data we collected from the data sources: https://github.com/1997mint/covert-transaction-model

Another one, ***Protection*** is how to use graph generative models to protect established covert transactions from being easily detected by graph-structured metrics, including training data and trained model files (model\*.pt).

The original paper has now been submitted to TIFS and is currently under review.
